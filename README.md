# C++ Programming and Data Structures/Algorithms Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the repository dedicated to C++ programming, pattern problem-solving, and Data Structures/Algorithms practice! This repository contains solutions to various pattern problems, coding exercises from C++ practice, and LeetCode's Data Structures and Algorithms section.

## Table of Contents

### Patterns

Explore a collection of C++ solutions to pattern-related problems. Each pattern problem is organized into its own directory for easy reference.

### C++ Code Practice

A compilation of C++ code snippets and small programs for practice. Covering various concepts and features of the C++ programming language.

### LeetCode Solutions

Solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms problems from LeetCode. Organized by problem categories for convenient navigation.

## How to Navigate

- **Patterns**: Inside the "Patterns" directory, you'll find subdirectories for each pattern type. Each subdirectory contains C++ solutions to problems related to that specific pattern.

- **Code Practice**: Browse the "CodePractice" directory to find small C++ programs and code snippets covering different aspects of the C++ language.

- **LeetCode**: The "LeetCode" directory is organized by problem categories (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists). Each category contains solutions to relevant problems.
