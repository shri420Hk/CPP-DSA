**#C++ Programming and Data Structures/Algorithms Repository**

**##Overview**

Welcome to the repository dedicated to C++ programming, pattern problem-solving, and Data Structures/Algorithms practice! This repository contains solutions to various pattern problems, as well as solutions to coding exercises from C++ practice and LeetCode's Data Structures and Algorithms section.

##**Table of Contents**

**Patterns**


Explore a collection of C++ solutions to pattern-related problems.
Each pattern problem is organized into its own directory for easy reference.

**C++ Code Practice**


A compilation of C++ code snippets and small programs for practice.
Covering various concepts and features of the C++ programming language.

**LeetCode Solutions**


Solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms problems from LeetCode.
Organized by problem categories for convenient navigation.

**How to Navigate**

Patterns: Inside the "Patterns" directory, you'll find subdirectories for each pattern type. Each subdirectory contains C++ solutions to problems related to that specific pattern.


Code Practice: Browse the "CodePractice" directory to find small C++ programs and code snippets covering different aspects of the C++ language.


LeetCode: The "LeetCode" directory is organized by problem categories (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists). Each category contains solutions to relevant problems.


**Contribution Guidelines**

Contributions are welcome! If you have additional pattern problems, interesting C++ code snippets, or solutions to LeetCode problems in C++, feel free to contribute.
